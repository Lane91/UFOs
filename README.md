# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to allow users to search through the UFO sighting info by being able to filter through multiple sets of criteria at the same time.

## Results 
To use the webpage the user would put in the information they are searching for in the provided data fields, then they would recieve the information they reuqested in the table to the right of the data fields.

## Summary
The main draeback is that this webpage is pulling information from a static set of data, that if not updated by someone would not provide the user with the most up to date information.
For further development, instead of having the user input the information code could be written to allow for dropdown menus in the data fields and that would also cut down on the user needing to have exact info in order to have something returned. I would also bring back the clickable button, as having something to click in order to return information may be more satisfactory to the end user.
